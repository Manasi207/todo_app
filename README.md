# React TO-DO List App

Develop a React To-Do List component allowing task addition, removal, and completion marking. Validate task input, display tasks dynamically, and offer optional sorting, filtering, and localStorage integration. Submit code on Git with brief testing guidance.

1. Created todolist app with add new todo item, edit item, delete item, and mark item as done functionality.
2. Added search functionality
3. Applied filters for todos by status (all, inprogress & completed)
4. Applied validations such as required fields and character & no digits validations.
5. Tried to applied meaningful validations using OpenAI API using node.
    (To avoid meaningless string "hi", "okay", "hello")
6. Added local storage to store todos, which will persist even after page refresh.
